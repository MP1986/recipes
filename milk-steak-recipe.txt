1 medium 8.8oz. (.25Kg) flat iron steak (top blade shoulder steak)
2 cup milk (preferably whole, called "4%")
1/4 cup honey
1/2 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp nutmeg
1 tsp vanilla extract
Garnish:
1/2 cup Jelly Belly® jelly beans




1.  Add the milk, honey, cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla to a medium sized saucepan.
2.  Heat up the mixture, stirring until the honey has completely dissolved.
3.  Bring the mixture to the boil.
4.  Carefully place the steak in the boiling milk mixture.
5.  Bring the liquid back to the boil and reduce the heat so that the milk is simmering.
6.  Cook this medium-sized steak for five minutes on one side, stirring the top occasionally to stop a skin forming on the milk.
7.  Turn the steak over and cook for a further five minutes on the other side.
8.  Check how well cooked your steak is. If you're after authenticity, the steak should be cooked "over hard" and so should not be pink at all.
9.  Allow the steak to rest for a few minutes.
10.  Garnish with jelly beans.
